a head that moves it's face and breathes

## software
* arduino code that moves the motors and plays the sounds
* arduino code to find the minimum and maximum positions of the motors
* processing code to convert after effects tracking (of jaw and eyebrows) keyframes to an c++ array (AnimationData.h) so kind of a poor persons motion capture
